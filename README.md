# Welcome to Home Not Alone!

## The Secret Santa Planning App
### Home Not Alone is dedicated to making planning your next Secret Santa super simple, while keeping everyone's secret gifts a Santa-sized surprise!

The responsive website allows registered users to create participant lists for gift giving activities, allowing easy inviting and assignment distribution, along with setting a recommended budget for all gifts involved. Users who are not registered are recommended to check out the website's About page, and are free to sign up for their own account. 

# [Link to Live Site](#)  

This project is created as a final hackathon project for Code Institute's 16 week fullstack developer bootcamp.  

Built by Team "Santa's Little Nerds": Jack, Bryan, Oleksii and Emma.

# UX

## Database Planning

Going into the planning stages, we knew that we would need three main models to plan out:
   - The User
   - The Event
   - The Participant 

![Database Entity Relationship Diagram](/docs/ERD.png)

- **Relationships:**
  - **Many-to-One with Event:**  
    Each `Participant` is linked to one `Event`, but an `Event` can have multiple `Participants`.
  
  - **One-to-One with User:**  
    Each `Participant` can be associated with one `User` account, allowing for personalized interactions and access.
  
  - **Self-Referential Many-to-One with Participant:**  
    Establishes the Secret Santa pairing by linking each `Participant` to another `Participant` as their recipient.

### **Key Points**

- **Role Management:**
  - Users are assigned to groups (`Organiser` or `Participant`) which determine their permissions and accessible features within the application.
  
- **Invitation Flow:**
  - **Organisers** can invite participants via email. Invited participants receive an invitation link to register and join the event.
  - Upon accepting an invitation, a participant's `user` field is populated, and they are assigned to the `Participant` group.
  
- **Secret Santa Assignments:**
  - Organisers can trigger the `random_santa` function, which shuffles participants and assigns each one a unique recipient.
  - The `assigned_recipient` field ensures that each participant knows who they are gifting to, maintaining the secrecy of the process.
  
- **Data Integrity:**
  - The use of foreign keys and one-to-one relationships ensures referential integrity within the database.
  - Deleting an `Event` cascades to remove all associated `Participants`, maintaining a clean database state.

## UX Design

### Overview


### Site User
Inspired by a classic Christmas movie from our childhoods, Home Not Alone is aimed at long distance friends and family groups, large parties, and work groups. While themed for Christmas, it is possible to reskin the project to fit other holidays in future.

There are two primary views on the site: 
1. **The Organiser**, who sets up the groups and issues invites to participants, and 
2. **The Participant**, who can see the name of their assigned gift recipient, the recipient's wish list, and the option to set up a wishlist of their own.

### Goal
This site's goal is to enable people to organise gift giving activities easily between large groups of people, particularly those who may be long distances away. 

## Wireframes

We made four wireframes to cover the layouts for 4 main pages: the front page, the sign in page, the sign up page, and the landing page when logged in.

# Agile Development

When collaborating on ideas for our group project, we created a dedicated Miro board. We ideated on our plans, broke it down into pieces to examine the purpose and target audience, and determined what key elements were needed for both the UX design and the Entity Relationship Diagram for Django.   
- [Home-not-Alone Miro Board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVL2ywJpk=/?share_link_id=472010981286)

![Miroboard Image](docs/homenotalone1.png)

We also set up a kanban board for tracking our project's user stories on GitHub's Projects site. Our project board can be found here: 
- [Home-not-Alone Project Board](https://github.com/users/jack-brosnan/projects/9)


### User Stories Overview

   - As a organiser I can create a new Secret Santa event so that I can easily host a gifting exchange for my group.

2. _User Story 2: Account Registration_
   - As an organiser, I can easily find the sign up page and create an account on the website that will let me host a gifting exchange for my group.
   - As a participant, I can easily accept the invite link and create an account to join my secret santa's group.

3. _User Story 3: Event Details_
   - As an organiser, I can create a new group with appropriate settings that will allow me to invite the correct participants.
   - As a participant, I can see what gift giving group I am a member of and the relevant requirements for the group.

4. _User Story 4: Participant Profile_
   - As an organiser, I can clearly see the names of all participants and who they have been assigned as their gift recipient.
   - As a participant, I can clearly see the name of my drawn gift recipient.
   - As a participant, I can add, modify and delete a wish list that will be shown to my gift giver.

5. _User Story 5: Secret Santa site theming_

# Features Implemented

## üìÑ Pages and Features

### **Home Page**
The central hub of the application dynamically displays content based on the user's role. Organisers can view and manage their events, while Participants access their portal to see event details, assigned recipients, and update their wishlists. Unauthenticated users are prompted to log in or register to gain access.

### **Add Event Page**
Allows Organisers to create new Secret Santa events by providing essential details such as title, description, budget, date, and an optional image. The form includes validation to ensure all required fields are correctly filled, and upon successful creation, Organisers receive a confirmation message.

### **Edit Event Page**
Enables Organisers to modify existing event details. Organisers can update information like the event's title, description, budget, date, and image. The page provides feedback on successful updates or errors if any issues arise during the editing process.

### **Delete Event**
Provides Organisers with the ability to remove events they have created. Upon confirmation, the event and all associated participants are permanently deleted from the database, and Organisers receive a success notification.

### **View Event Page**
Offers Organisers a detailed view of a specific event, including all participants involved. From this page, Organisers can manage participants, send invitations, and initiate the random assignment of Secret Santas. It serves as a comprehensive overview of the event's current state.

### **Edit Participant Page**
Allows Organisers to manage participants within an event. They can add new participants by entering their name and email, edit existing participant details, or remove participants as needed. The page ensures that all participant information is accurately maintained.

### **Random Santa Assignment**
Enables Organisers to randomly assign each participant a recipient for Secret Santa gifting. The feature ensures that each participant is paired with a unique recipient, preventing self-assignment. Once assignments are made, Organisers receive a confirmation message.

### **Invite Participant**
Facilitates Organisers in sending invitation emails to participants who have not yet registered. By entering a participant's email, Organisers can send a personalized invitation link, enabling them to join the event and participate in the Secret Santa exchange.

### **Participant Portal (Integrated into Home Page)**
Serves as the dedicated space for Participants to interact with their Secret Santa event. Participants can view event details, see their assigned recipient and the recipient's wishlist, and update their own wishlist items. The portal provides real-time feedback upon successfully updating the wishlist.

### **User Authentication Pages**
Handled by `django-allauth`, these pages manage user registration, login, logout, and password management. New users can register or accept invitations, existing users can securely log in, and all users can reset their passwords via email if needed.

### **Admin Dashboard**
Utilizes Django's built-in admin interface to provide superusers and staff members with comprehensive management capabilities. Administrators can manage users, events, and participants, ensuring full oversight and control over the application's data and functionalities.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Additional Features

### **Role-Based Access Control**
Implements distinct permissions for Organisers and Participants. Organisers have the authority to create and manage events and participants, while Participants can view event details, their assigned recipients, and manage their own wishlists.

### **Email Integration**
Configured to send emails using Gmail's SMTP server, allowing Organisers to send invitations and Participants to receive notifications. Email credentials are securely managed through environment variables, ensuring sensitive information remains protected.

### **Frontend Enhancements**
Incorporates responsive design principles to ensure usability across various devices. Utilizes Crispy Forms with Bootstrap 5 for enhanced form rendering and Cloudinary for efficient image storage and delivery.

### **Security Measures**
Ensures the application follows best security practices by storing sensitive information in environment variables, enforcing strong password policies, and implementing access controls through middleware and decorators.

# Future Features

### **1. Switch to SendGrid for Email Sending**

**Current Implementation:**

Currently, the application utilizes Gmail's SMTP server to send essential emails such as invitations and notifications. While Gmail SMTP is effective for development and small-scale deployments, it presents limitations in scalability, deliverability, and advanced email management features.

**Planned Enhancement:**

Transitioning to **SendGrid**, a dedicated email service provider, will offer numerous advantages that enhance the application's email capabilities and overall user experience.
